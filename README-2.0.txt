The jWebUnit team is pleased to announce the jWebUnit 2.0 release!

http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net

jWebUnit is a Java framework that facilitates creation of acceptance tests for
web applications. It evolved from a project where we were using HttpUnit and
JUnit to create acceptance tests. As the tests were being written, they were
continuously refactored to remove duplication and other bad smells in the test
code. jWebUnit is the result of these refactorings.

Changes in this version include:

  New Features:

o Selenium plugin

  Fixed bugs:

  Changes:

o Move to JDK 1.5


Have fun!
