Embedding Captials is at the heart of how this variant of WikiWiki organizes links to other (internal) wiki pages.



The current rule for "recognized link patterns" is:

* Uppercase followed by one or more lowercase/number, repeated at least twice.

Helpful anti-examples: ThisIsNotALinK (fails on uppercase being final letter). Nor_Is_This (fails on unusual character, i.e. underscore, "not [A-Z][a-z|0-9]")
