	<p>
		Ant is make for Java. Most open source Java projects use Ant as their build tool. With ant
		you can compile, test, package your release with just a few lines of XML code in the <tt>build.xml</tt>
		file.
	</p>
	<subsection name="Installing Ant">
		<p>
			You need to have <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> installed. The latest version at the moment
			of this writing is version 1.6.1.
		</p>
		<p>
			After you've installed Ant, don't forget to set the <tt>ANT_HOME</tt> environment variable, and
			to put <tt>%ANT_HOME%\bin</tt> to your path (Unix users use $ANT_HOME/bin).
		</p>
		<p>
			And last, but not least, copy the file <tt>junit-3.8.1.jar</tt> from the <tt>jWebUnit\lib</tt> 
			directory to <tt>%ANT_HOME%\lib</tt>, or else your build <em>will</em> fail!
		</p>
	</subsection>
	<subsection name="Building jWebUnit">
		<p>
			All you have to do is call:
			<source>ant clean-dist</source>
			and Ant will do the rest. The java source will be compiled, 
			the javadocs generated, tests performed and a jar-file created.
		</p>
	</subsection>
	<subsection name="Building a release">
		<p>
			The preferred method of building a release is using maven. However,
			if you don't want to use <a href="http://maven.apache.org">maven</a>, you can use <source>ant clean-dist</source>
			for creating the distribution zip-file.
