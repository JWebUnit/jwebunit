CHANGES SINCE RC1:

**Additional Functionality**

Support for Radio Options
Methods were added to support interaction with and testing of radio button
groups.

Select boxes
Methods were added to support interaction with and testing of single-select
elements.  Multi-select elements are not yet supported.


**API Changes**

FormControl renamed to FormElement
Methods related to setting and testing of form input fields were renamed for
consistency.  All such methods now refer to "FormElement".

InResponse renamed to Present
AssertXInResponse methods were renamed to AssertXPresent for consistency with
other method names.

Multiple Form support simplified
The two submitForm methods (submitForm(formName) and
submitForm(formName, buttonName)) where removed.  To explicitly indicate which
form to work with on a multi-form page, use the new setWorkingForm method.  The
two remaining submit methods (submit() and submit(buttonName)) are used to
submit the form when ready.

ClickLink signature change
clickLink parameter is now the link id.  To navigate a link based on text
contained in the link, use clickLinkWithText.


**Miscellaneous**

Access to HttpUnit Response, Request, WebConversation opened up.

New HttpUnit (1.4.5) utilized, which provides JavaScript support.

HttpUnitDialog class changed to act as a WebClientListener and update the
response upon responseReceived call back.

Updated to JUnit 3.8.1
