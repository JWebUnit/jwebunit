The JWebUnit team is pleased to announce the JWebUnit 3.1 release!

http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net

JWebUnit is a Java framework that facilitates creation of acceptance tests for
web applications. It evolved from a project where we were using HttpUnit and 
JUnit to create acceptance tests. As the tests were being written, they were 
continuously refactored to remove duplication and other bad smells in the test 
code. JWebUnit is the result of these refactorings.
We are using HtmlUnit (htmlunit.sourceforge.net).

Changes in this version are available here:

Have fun!
