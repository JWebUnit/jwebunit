            <p>
                In order to build JWebUnit, you need to
                have Maven installed. This should not be any more
                difficult than installing ant. We've included a best
                practice installation and configuration for Maven.
            </p>
            <subsection name="Installing Sun JDK 1.6">
                <p>
                    JWebUnit is compiled with JDK 1.6 to ensure compatibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You need to download and install latest Sun JDK 1.6 for your platform.
                    Let's say the JDK location is:
                    <source>/opt/jdk1.6.0_22</source>
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Installing Maven">
                <p>
                    First you need to download the latest Maven, which
                    currently is
                    <a href="http://maven.apache.org">
                        <tt>Maven-3.2.1</tt>
                    </a>
                    , make sure you download the binary archive
                    (e.g. apache-maven-3.2.1-bin.tar.bz2).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Installing Maven should be easy: extract the file to
                    any directory you like, let's say:
                    <source>/opt/apache-maven-3.2.1</source>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next you need to do 2 things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            add an environment variable M2_HOME which
                            points to the install directory of Maven,
                            i.e. /opt/apache-maven-3.2.1
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            add
                            <tt>$M2_HOME/bin</tt> (Linux) or <tt>%M2_HOME%\bin</tt> (Windows)
                            to your path (using the variable you can
                            switch more easily when a new version
                            arrives)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can test that Maven is correctly installed by running in a shell:
                    <tt>mvn -v</tt>
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Using Maven">
                <p>
                    Maven defines several goals, for creating and
                    building your application. A goal is similar to an
                    Ant-task. For instance: to compile the java sources
                    one could do:
                    <source>mvn compile</source>
                    Also, a goal can depend on other goals: the
                    <tt>package</tt>
                    goal depends on running the unit tests and
                    compilation of the code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    See the
                    <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven site</a>
                    for more information on the different goals and
                    plugins that are available.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Building JWebUnit">
                <p>
                    Building JWebUnit merely consist of running Maven:
                    <source>mvn install</source>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You now have successfully built JWebUnit. The files
                    are in your private repository. To remove all traces of
                    generated files, allowing your repository to install from
                    scratch, use:
                    <source>mvn clean</source>
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Testing JWebUnit">
                <p>
                  JWebUnit is supported with a suite of test cases, which
                  ensure that the testing framework works as expected.
                  These tests are run through Maven by running:
                    <source>mvn test</source>
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Using Eclipse">
                <p>
                  If you are using the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse IDE</a>
                  to develop the JWebUnit plugin,
                  you can use <a href="http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/">m2eclipse</a>.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Building Sourceforge upload bundle">
                <p>
                    For those who don't want to use Maven, we have to
                    provide a zip with all required files.
                    <source>mvn package assembly:assembly</source>
                </p>
                <p>The files are in target directory.</p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Building JWebUnit Web site and reports">
                <p>
                Due to findbugs memory usage, following parameter is required:
                <source>export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx384M</source>
                Now you should be able to generate site:
                    <source>mvn site</source>
                </p>
                <p>The files are in target/site directory of each module.<br/>
                If you want to test the final assembled site, just hit:</p>
                <source>mvn site:stage -DstagingDirectory=C:\fullsite</source>
                <p>You can of course customize the destination folder of the assembled site.</p>
