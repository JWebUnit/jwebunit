    <body class="default">
        <section name="How-To Release JWebUnit with Maven">
            <p>
                This todo list if a reminder for JWebUnit release manager.
            </p>
            <subsection name="Last checks and updates">
                <p>
                	<ul>
                		<li>Ensure your repository is up to date by running: <tt>svn update</tt></li>
                		<li>Edit <tt>src/changes/changes.xml</tt> to set the release date instead of "unknow"</li>
                		<li>Update readme.txt (at least update the version number)</li>
                		<li>Update JWebUnit latest version in src/site/xdoc/index.xml, src/site/xdoc/installation.xml, jwebunit-htmlunit-plugin/src/site/xdoc/index.xml, jwebunit-selenium-plugin/src/site/xdoc/index.xml</li>
                		<li>Commit the changes</li>
                	</ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now check that in your <tt>settings.xml</tt> (usually in <tt>~/.m2</tt>) 
                    the JWebUnit server details are correct:
                    <source><![CDATA[                    
    <server>
      <id>jwebunit-website</id>
      <username>henryju</username>
      <password>XXXXXXXX</password>
    </server>
    <server>
      <id>jwebunit.svn.sourceforge.net</id>
      <username>henryju</username>
      <password>XXXXXXXX</password>
    </server>
    
    <server>
      <id>sonatype-nexus</id>
      <username>henryju</username>
      <password>YYYYYYYYYY</password>
    </server>
]]></source>
                    Don't forget to put your own sourceforge account and password for jwebunit-website and svn. Concerning sonatype-nexus you need
                    the username and password from http://oss.sonatype.org/ (see <a href="https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide">OSS Repository Hosting</a>)
                    for instructions on how to set up your configuration like GPG signature.
                    Reminder: in order to have access granted to a new JWebUnit developper, ask on <a href="https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-384">OSSRH-384</a>.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Preparing the release (tag and update pom)">
                <p>
                    This process is automatically done by maven-release-plugin.
                    <source>mvn release:prepare -Dusername=henryju -Dpassword=XXXXXX</source>
                    Don't forget to put your own sourceforge account and password.<br/>
                    The plugin will ask for next release version, tag name and next development version. Most of the time defaults are ok.<br/>
                    <em>NB:</em> Sometimes with SVN 1.5 the tag operation fails with a message like <tt>file XXX already exists</tt>. The solution is
                    to run <tt>svn update</tt> then run <tt>mvn release:prepare -Dusername=henryju -Dpassword=XXXXXX</tt> again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the tag is done in SVN and the trunk is ready for next developments. It's time to actually do the release.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Perform the release (deploy artifacts and site)">
               	<p>
                    The process is done by maven-release-plugin.
                    <source>mvn release:perform -Darguments="-Dgpg.passphrase=XXXXXXXXXX"</source>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will automatically checkout the tag from SVN in target/checkout folder then run <tt>mvn deploy site-deploy</tt>.
                    Artifacts will be staged in http://oss.sonatype.org.
                    Site will also be uploaded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now connect to http://oss.sonatype.org and go to <i>Staging Repositories</i> section. There you can close and release the repository.
                  If everything is fine the artifacts will be synced to Maven central.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Dealing with non-maven bundle">
                <p>
                  We also provide a bundle for non Maven users.
                    <source>
cd target
cd checkout
mvn package assembly:assembly
                    </source>
                    This will create a release bundle in [target/checkout/]target/jwebunit-XX-release.zip and a source bundle in [target/checkout/]target/jwebunit-XX-source-release.zip. 
                </p>
