<section name="Migrating from 2.x to 3.0">
	<p>JWebUnit was migrated internally to use JUnit 4 API instead of old JUnit 3. While it should be unnoticed for most end users, here are a few things you should check.</p>

	<p><b>1. Replace all occurrence of junit.framework.AssertionFailedError by java.lang.AssertionError.</b>
	For example if you have code like this:
	<source>
        try {
            setTextField("nonexistent", "anyvalue");
            fail("Expected AssertionFailedError");
        } catch (AssertionFailedError e) {
            //OK it was expected
        }
	</source>
    Replace it with:	
    <source>
        try {
            setTextField("nonexistent", "anyvalue");
            fail("Expected AssertionError");
        } catch (AssertionError e) {
            //OK it was expected
        }
    </source>
	Or better use JUnit 4 <i>expected</i> feature: <tt>@Test(expected=AssertionError.class)</tt>
	</p>
