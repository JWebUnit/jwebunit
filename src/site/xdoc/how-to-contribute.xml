        <section name="How-To contribute to JWebUnit">
            <p>
                JWebUnit is an open-source project and is looking for contributors. Please read the following sections if you plan to help.
            </p>
            <subsection name="What needs to be done?">
                <p>
                    Here are some ideas:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Improve Selenium plugin (should ideally pass 100% unit tests). May need some modifications of the API.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Improve Web 2.0 support (AJAX, drag&amp;drop, focus, mouse clicks, keypress, ...). Will need additions/modifications of the API.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Take advantage of Java 5 (migrate to JUnit 4, use generics, ...)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Create a record tool like SeleniumIDE or WebTestRecorder.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Of course these are simple suggestions and you can propose many different things.
                </p>

            <subsection name="OK, I want to help. How to start with?">
                <p>
                    First, you need to do your homeworks. Checkout latest code from trunk then try to <a href="building-maven.html">build JWebUnit with Maven</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please subscribe to the developper mailing-list and tell me what feature you are working on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will review your first contribution and if it doesn't break anything you will certainly be granted with commit rights (you need a sourceforge account for that).
