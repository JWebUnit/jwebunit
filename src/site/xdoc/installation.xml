	<subsection name="Download">
		<p>
			If you don't want to use Maven, you can download files manually.
			First download latest stable version of JWebUnit from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jwebunit/files">files area</a>
			and expand to a local directory.
		</p>
	</subsection>
	<subsection name="Choose what plugin you want to use">
		<p>
			There are currently 2 available plugins:
			<ul>
				<li>HtmlUnit: A good choice if you want fast tests and good Javascript support.</li>
				<li>Webdriver: BETA quality (not all the JWebUnit API could be executed with Webdriver)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</subsection>
	<subsection name="Integrate with IDE">
		<p>
			The simplest way to manage dependencies in Eclipse when you use Maven 2 is to use m2e plugin.
		</p>
		<p>			
			If you don't want to use Maven, 
			make sure you add the jwebunit-htmlunit-plugin-XX.jar, jwebunit-core-XX.jar and all HtmlUnit dependencies
(these files are in lib/ folder of the JWebUnit package) to your classpath in your IDE.
