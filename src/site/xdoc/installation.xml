  <subsection name="Download">
    <p>
      If you don't want to use Maven, you can download files manually.
      First download latest stable version of JWebUnit from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jwebunit/files">files area</a>
      and expand to a local directory.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection name="Choose what plugin you want to use">
    <p>
      There are currently 2 available plugins:
      <ul>
        <li>HtmlUnit: A good choice if you want fast tests and good Javascript support.</li>
        <li>Webdriver: BETA quality (not all the JWebUnit API could be executed with Webdriver)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection name="Integrate with IDE">
    <p>
      The simplest way to manage dependencies in Eclipse when you use Maven 2 is to use m2e plugin.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't want to use Maven,
      make sure you add the jwebunit-htmlunit-plugin-XX.jar, jwebunit-core-XX.jar and all HtmlUnit dependencies
(these files are in lib/ folder of the JWebUnit package) to your classpath in your IDE.
