	<subsection name="Integrate with IDE">
		<p>
			The simplest way to manage dependencies is to use Maven 2. If you don't want to
			migrate to Maven, make sure you add the XXX-plugin (where XXX is the plugin you choose) and core jar files to your classpath in your IDE.
			You will also need numerous additionnal dependencies, depending on what plugin you choose.
			Please refer to each plugin page to know the dependencies they need.
